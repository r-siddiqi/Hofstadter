# Introduction
Condensed matter physics realizes the importance of 2D materials when it comes to the observation of interesting phenomena (ie. optical, magnetic, etc) and topological properties as well as technological applications. 
Different 2D materials have different underlying lattice structures. Some common ones are the square lattice, the honeycomb lattice, triangular/hexagonal lattice, and the kagome lattice. 

These lattices can be described via Hamiltonians encoding how a species could "hop" between adjacent sites (nearest neighbors). A useful way to understand these systems is by diagonalizing the associated Hamiltonians to obtain allowed energies and states, and use these eigenvalues and eigenvectors to compute various parameters. In general, it is useful to plot the eigenvalue spectrum, different eigenvectors, density of states, and the inverse participation ratio. In the case of a magnetic field application perpendicular to the lattice, plotting the Hofstader butterfly is a primary result. Generally, the band structure of these systems is useful to compute, but energy band theory is dependent on the concept of crytal momentum --- a relevant parameter when it comes to describing translational symmetry in the lattice via Bloch's theorem. However, Block's theorem does not hold in cases like hyperbolic lattice connectivity. There is also little support for computing Hofstader butterflies while there exist multiple Python packages referring to band theory calculations. This brings us to what is interesting about our implementation of lattice simulations in this repository:

- We create base cases for the most common, physically realizable lattice types without reliance on crystal momentum to allow for extending this code to cases where Bloch's theorem no longer holds.
- We account for the presence of additional on-site disorder as well as a constant, perpendicular magnetic field. This allows us to simulate Anderson localization and plot Hofstader butterflies with and without disorder. The magnetic field support also sets the stage for further invesitgation into the quantum hall effect.
- The classes creating the hamiltonians for each lattice type can be modified or refactored to support additional parameters or more accurately reflect a particular type of material such as graphene.

## Tight-Binding Hamiltonian
Suppose we take an atom. There are orbitals associated with it that describe regions where electrons could exist -- these are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian describing our atom. But what if we configure our atom with other atoms in a crystalline configuration? 
How do we describe the energy of a system where particles are placed in a crystalline configuration?
The following tight-binding Hamiltonian describes lattices in the absence of external interactions while accounting for hopping:
$$H = \omega_0 \sum_i a_i^\dag a_i - t \sum_{<i,j>} (a_i^\dag a_j + a_j^\dag a_i)$$
where $\omega_0$ is the on-site energy. The first sum runs over all lattice sites. The second sum describes hopping between nearest neighbors with a hopping amplitude $t$. It also encodes lattice geometry. 

When we're simulating specific lattice types, it's actually easier to construct a Hamiltonian in terms of a matrix populated by considering the lattice geometry. By this, we mean populating an N x N matrix based on the nearest neighbor hopping as it would occur on a particular lattice.

## Anderson Localization

## Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR)

The "participation ratio" gives an estimation of the localization length:
$$IPR = \frac{(\sum_x |\psi(x)|^2)^2}{ \sum_x |\psi(x)|^4}$$
(the numerator is not necessary if wavefunctions are normalized).

## Density of States

## Hofstader Butterflies
What happens when we apply a perpendicular, uniform magnetic field onto a lattice? The general tight-binding hamiltonian will now involve a "Peierls phase" accounting for the magnetic flux through each plaquette as well as relevant changes in the boundary conditions.
An interesting result is that if we plot the energies as a function of magnetic flux ratios ($\phi = p/q$) such that p and q are coprime integers, we obtain a fractal pattern. It is a recursive structure. The way we constructed the butterfly involved choosing a maximum value for q, iterating through all the coprime p,q pairs leading up to that point, and then reconstructing the hamiltonian for each consequent $\phi = p/q$.

# Potential Applications
The code in this repository simulates some basic tight-binding hamiltonians specific to common 2D lattice types found in materials with the option to introduce on-site disorder or a uniform magnetic field. Modifications would need to be made in order to simulate specific 2D materials or account for more complicated/specific defects, a non-uniform magnetic field, or other complex systems. 
A non-exhaustive list of possible applications of this code is as follows: 
- Simulating graphene (twisted-bilayer graphene)
- Hyperbolic Circuit QED
- Realizing the quantum hall effect in various moir√© materials
