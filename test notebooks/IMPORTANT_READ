This folder contains multiple test notebooks that were intermittently added to in order to ensure that all of the plotting functions worked and the hamiltonians were constructed properly. Plotting the butterfly structure sufficed as a check for accuracy in that regard since mistakes in the implementation of the Peierls phase or geometry were easy to catch if the butterfly did not match the literature or did not present a fractal structure.
